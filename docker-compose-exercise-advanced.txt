1. Create a multicontainer app using Spring Boot as service layer connecting to a MySql database.
2. You can use Spring Initializr to build your Spring Boot aplication core -> https://start.spring.io/
3. Implement some CRUD operations using REST Services
4. The FrontEnd must not necessarily be a web framework. To trigger CRUD operations towards a service one can use for example the Postman API platform
  E.g. for adding new users POST the following JSON string to the URL:
      { 
        "id": 3,
        "firstName": "john",
        "lastName":"mueller",
        "email": "fm@gmail.com"
      }
  5. As a model for docker-compose.yml you can take a look at the docker-compose-springboot-mysql.yml file and adapt it to your need accordingly
